(Read the effing article! Form your own opinions!)

A simple chrome extension that hides comment threads on news aggregator sites (currently HackerNews and Reddit) until after you've read the article.

Why?
----
On these sites I have an unfortunate habit of going to the comments to get the "gist" and then skipping the article entirely. I'm trying to break this habit... and spend less time in comment sections in general.

And I wanted to try building a chrome extension. (It was fun. B+!)

How?
----
As it turns out, for [security reasons](http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/03/privacy-related-changes-coming-to-css-vistited/) you can't actually use js to determine whether a user has visited a link. So this extension manually keeps track of your last few hundred pages visited from HN/Reddit. In practice this works well enough.
